General Comments and Disclaimer
-------------------------------

Tom (aka cablepair) has shown to be conservative in estimations on both the hashing speed
and power requirements of his products. _However_, the estimates may be higher (or lower)
if custom firmware, or overclocking is employed.

Units used are Volts (V), Amperes (A), Watts (W) and Gigahashes per second (Ghash/s or
Gh/s).

**This is an unofficial FAQ**. I (XertroV) and other contributors claim no credibility.

Recommended Reading
-------------------

Some basic understanding of electrical principles is recommended. This includes knowing
the relationship between volts, amperes and watts. Wikipedia can help you if you need a
basic intro.

See:

* [Ampere or Amp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere)
* [Volt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volts)
* [Watt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt)

Note that **W = V dot A**; dot here is referring to the [Dot
Product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product). Since there is no imaginary / vector
component it can be treated as regular multiplication.

Shipping and assembly
---------------------

### Shipping Dates

Currently Tom is [on
schedule](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1312091#msg1312091) to ship
around the [first week of
December](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1257857#msg1257857) *for the
first
batch*. 

_Note_: there has been some ambiguity regarding what ["first week after
thanksgiving"](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1257857#msg1257857) means.
Tom has stated this is the [next business
week](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1291185#msg1291185) following the
week containing Thanksgiving. A realistic timeframe is approximately __after the 26th of 
Nov. but before the 7th of Dec.__

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1257857#msg1257857

The second batch is set to ship January of 2013 (as per
[bitcoinasic.net](http://www.bitcoinasic.net)). Tom has stated it should ship a month
after the first batch. (IRC #btcfpga; 20121106)

[section last here removed due to being complete speculation]

### Shipping Methods

Standard is USPS, though an upgrade to DHL is available.

Persons inside the United States won't notice the upgrade much; however, those outside the
US (and possibly Canada) should notice a [large
improvement](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1294089#msg1294089) in
shipping time.

### Fabrication

"ASICs have been in fabrication for some weeks now" [(on 27th October,
2012)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1300687#msg1300687)

### Assembly

The assembly house used is able to assemble [1000 boards in 5
days](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1300687#msg1300687). The assembly
house is [thought](https://www.btcfpga.com/forum/index.php?topic=21.msg148#msg148) to be

Power Requirements
------------------

Tom has [stated](https://www.btcfpga.com/forum/index.php?topic=4.msg132#msg132) that
power requirements are estimated to be:

* 27 Gh/s: 50 - 60 Watts
* 54 Gh/s: 100 - 120 Watts

Both are thus **1.85 - 2.22 W / Gh/s**

The estimate of 100 W per 54 Gh/s bASIC is used throughout this document, and
approximately half for 27 Gh/s models.

Power Supplies and Connectors
-----------------------------

### Power Connectors

Both bASIC models will have a 4 pin molex connector and a barrel connector (aka female DC
coaxial connector).
[(Source)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1315070#msg1315070)

The barrel connector is _thought_ to be a centre +'ve
[2.1](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1314859#msg1314859) or
[2.5](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1315524#msg1315524) mmID 5.5 mmOD
type. (ID = inside diameter, OD = outside diameter). It should be able to provide 12 V and
10 A (DC of course). It seems 2.1/5.5 centre +'ve connectors are uncommon above 5 A, so a
2.5/5.5 connector might be more likely (often rated for up to 10 A).

**If you are buying a wall wart** please buy a _high quality_ power adapter. There is no
sense in ruining a thousand dollar piece of machinery due to a below average power
adaptor.

Cablez [sells PSU to 2.1/5.5 & 2.5/5.5 DC
plugs](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=74397.0) 
compatible with BitFoce singles (Tom 
[has stated](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1315070#msg1315070) that at 
least the dimensions are the same. The linked post is ambiguous as to power needs;
however, it is likely these are identical to PSU requirements: DC, 12 V, 10 A)

[Images](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1314785#msg1314785).


### Power Supplies

A bASIC [*will not*](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1315070#msg1315070)
ship with any power supply.

However, you can buy a PSU that is compatible from Tom's store
[here](https://www.bitcoinasic.net/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=54).
This PSU will be able to power up to 10 bASIC mining units. If you are planning on running
less than 10 a smaller PSU (in terms of wattage) might be more appropriate.

Please exercise due diligence with regards to PSUs. Having $10,000 worth of equipment on
one PSU provides no hedging. If this concerns you, please consider using multiple PSUs
(possibly with a lower maximum wattage each) in order to spread risk. This is *especially*
true with lower quality PSUs.

**Please be sure to use quality** PSUs and be sure not to stress them too hard to give
yourself the lowest risk factor you can. It is reccomended you keep the wattage below 80%
or so of the maximum rating on a PSU. This is more important than a PSU for gaming or a
normal system as this PSU will be running *constantly*.

### What Should I Know When Purchasing a PSU

(This section is possibly inaccurate - I'm not that experienced with the matter. If
someone could read over this and confirm it's not inaccurate I would be appreciative)

I believe you should be looking at the number of 12v rails available and the amperage
supplied to each, since that is what will be powering your bASIC.

At 12 V one 54 Gh/s model will require 8.4 amps. 

The SeaSonic 1000 W PSU sold by Tom has a single rail at 12 V able to provide 83 A and so
is able to provided 12 V * 83 A = ~1000 W.

I have personally bought
[this](https://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=14393). It
has one 12 V rail at 40 A; so 480 W total. This would allow me to safely power up to four
54 Gh/s bASICs and perhaps one 27 Gh/s bASIC in addition to the previous four.

If you were to buy a PSU with three 12V rails that each provided 13 A you would be able to
power just *three* bASICs (54 Gh/s model). While the total (3 \* 12 \* 13 = 468 W) would
normally be able to power at least four 54 Gh/s bASICs, since you are restricted by each
rail, in reality you can only power (3 \* floor(12 \* 13 / 100) = 3) three bASICs. 

**Note:** floor(12 \* 13 / 100) gives the number of bASICs you can run from each rail

#### Formula:

I believe the general formula would be:

__Num-rails \* floor(rail-volts \* rail-amps / 100 Watts) = Num-bASICs__

### What is Required when Purchasing a Wall Wart with Barrel Connector

(Todo - need confirmation of barrel connector details)



bASIC details
-------------

* 27 Gh/s: one 6 chip cluster with heatsink and fan; 90 nm architecture
* 54 Gh/s: two 6 chip clusters with a heatsink and fan over each cluster; 90 nm
architecture

### Production details

Tasks handled by the assembly firm and their engineers:
[(Source)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1238806#msg1238806)

* Designing the production board
* Fabrication of PCB's
* Assembly of boards to completion

After this the final boards will be shipped to Tom. Then - with a team of full time
employees the following will occur:
[(Source)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1238806#msg1238806)

* Open boxes
* Load Firmware
* Test bASICs for 24 hours each
* Box up and ship

Production and assembly will be a long process, and may take up to a week.

### bASIC Physical Dimensions

* 27 Gh/s: 5 x 4 inches; 12.7 x 10.2 cm (rounded up to nearest mm)
* 54 Gh/s: 9 x 4 inches; 22.9 x 10.2 cm (rounded up to nearest mm)

### SHA256 Core

The SHA256 Core (the heart of the ASIC) has [been provided by a 'well known' company from
outside the US](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1157886#msg1157886). They
are a top design firm in regards to these types of cores.





Will I need to pay Import Duties if I'm in the EU
-------------------------------------------------

[This page
(ec.europa.eu)](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/measures.jsp?Lang=en&
SimDate=20121105&Area=US&Taric=8542319000&LangDescr=en)
seems to indicate that import duties will be 0%.

You may be required to pay VAT if you don't have a VAT number. This will be changed on the
total customs value (e.g. $1069 per bASIC + $90 for DHL). The authors encourage you to
research this for your particular case.
[http://www.dutycalculator.com/](http://www.dutycalculator.com/) may be of assistance.

Do bASICs need to be okay'd by the FCC
--------------------------------------

This is unlikely because they are shipped as components and not a stand-alone machine.
Despite this, Tom [will be ensuring that bASICs are within FCC
regulations](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1313940#msg1313940). You
need not worry about this.

### Is it Safe?

Tom has stated they have a complete security system and they are located in close
proximity to a police station. In addition, when ASICs are being assembled there will be a
staff member present around the clock.
