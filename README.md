FAQ for the bASIC sold by BTCFPGA / BitcoinASIC

The primary source is [this thread on
bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637). Later pages are more
relevant.

General Comments
----------------

Tom (aka cablepair) has shown to be conservative in estimations on both the hashing speed
and power requirements of his products. _However_, the estimates may be higher (or lower)
if custom firmware, or overclocking is employed.

Power Requirements
------------------

Current power estimates are [*at
most*](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1315070#msg1315070) 125 watts for
a 54 Ghash/s bASIC and approximately half for a 27 Ghash/s model.

A far more likely figure is under 100 watts.

Power Connectors
----------------

Both bASIC models will have a 4 pin molex connector and a barrel connector (aka female DC
coaxial connector).

The barrel connector is
(thought)[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1314859#msg1314859] to be a
centre +'ve 2.1 mmID 5.5 mmOD type. (ID = inside diameter, OD = outside diameter)

Power Supplies
--------------

A bASIC *will not* ship with any power supply.

However, you can buy a PSU that is compatible from Tom's store
[here](https://www.bitcoinasic.net/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=54).
This PSU will be able to power up to 10 bASIC mining units. If you are planning on running
less than 10 a smaller PSU (in terms of wattage) might be more appropriate.
