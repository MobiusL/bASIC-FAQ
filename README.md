General Comments
----------------

Tom (aka cablepair) has shown to be conservative in estimations on both the hashing speed and power requirements of his products. _However_, the estimates may be higher (or lower) if custom firmware, or overclocking is employed.

Power Requirements
------------------

Current power estimates are [*at most*](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79637.msg1315070#msg1315070) 125 watts for a 54 Ghash/s bASIC and approximately half for a 27 Ghash/s model.

A far more likely figure is under 100 watts.
