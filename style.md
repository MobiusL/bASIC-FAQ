Style Guide
===========

Here's a rough style guide.

*Italics* should be used to provide emphasis.

**Bold** should be used to grab attention and provide emphasis.

Secondary headings should be used for major categories.

Tertiary headings should be used for subcategories or topics more removed from the parent
secondary category but still related. Examples are particulars about shipping or formulae
(respectively).

Documents should be hard wrapped at 90 characters. Don't worry too much about this, if
there are any pull requests that don't conform XertroV will fix them up.
